In this sense the word includes ordinary arrangements as to time and manner of delivery and of payment of the purchase price, etc-in other words the so-called accidentalia of the contract. In the sense of a true suspensive or resolutive condition, however, the word has a much more limited meaning, viz. of a qualification which renders the operation and consequences of the whole contract dependent upon an uncertain future event…. Where the qualification defers the operation of the contract, the condition is suspensive, and where it provides for dissolution of the contract after interim operation, the condition is resolutive. The exact dividing line between the two classes is sometimes difficult to draw, because failure of a suspensive condition may have a resolutive effect, and a resolutive condition in a sense suspends dissolution of the contract. But for present purposes that aspect of the matter need not be pursued. What is of importance is the distinction between true conditions of either kind and ordinary stipulations falling outside their category. In the case of true conditions the parties by specific agreement introduce contingency as to the existence or otherwise of the contract, whereas provisions which are not true conditions bind the parties as to their fulfilment and on breach give rise to ordinary contractual remedies of a compensatory nature, i.e. (depending on the circumstances) specific performance, damages, cancellation or certain combinations of these…” ")]),a("p",[e._v(" The above -mentioned case was very instrumental to the judgment of the Swaziland High Court in the case of Norlaw Investments (Pty) Ltd v Eric Slabbert Agencies (Pty) Ltd5.

Other jurists have suggested from time to time that where there is a suspensive condition there is no contract at all until the condition has been fulfilled.8 Note that this view is due to a misconception that the contract will not be binding unless a certain condition is fulfilled. But it is important to note the literal meaning of the word ‘suspensive’- an operative principle denoting the suspension of an obligation, not the entire agreement. Gibson9 and Sharrock10 therefore argue that a contract that is subject to a suspensive condition is a valid and binding contract from the moment of its conclusion.

The case involved two companies: Johannesburg Consolidated Investment (JCI) which was a minority shareholder in Macduff & Co. JCI had entered into a contract with Macduff whereby the latter would undergo voluntary liquidation.
