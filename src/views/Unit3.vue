                As mentioned in LAW203, one of the essential requirements of valid contracts is that, the intended
                contract must be capable of performance. This basically means that the obligations arising from the 
                contract must be deliverable. Recall the one aspect of performance we covered in LAW203, that is, 
                impossibility of performance. In this unit, we will deal with specific performance as a contractual 
                right and as a remedy. We will also briefly discuss the legal effect of ‘incomplete performance’ and
                ‘defective performance’ in comparison with complete performance.

                  <p>
                      One critical aspect of contracts is that, in terms of the law, an aggrived party can seek an order of
                      specific performance from Court in order to compell the defaulting party to perform. The right to order
                      specific performance emanates from the fact that contrats create obligations which must be performed and 
                      each party is expected to deliver its obligations.You will recall that in Law203we discussed that a contract
                      creates obligations or a duty to perform.Therefore, once a valid contract is concluded, the parties must honour 
                      their obligations, and that is where the element of performance comes into operation.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                      Let us begin by examining what is specific performance in contract.In accordance with the general principle <i>pacta sunt servanda</i><sup>44</sup> 
                      ,the parties to a contract are obliged to fulfil their contractual undertakings<sup>45</sup> . It follows that 
                      each party has a right to expect and to claim perfomrance from the other. Specific performance therefore forms one 
                      of the primary remedies for breach of contract. An order of specifc performance is an order of court compelling a
                      contracting pary to render the very performance that the party agreed to make in terms of the contract<sup>46</sup> .
                  </p>
                  <p>
                      In the case of <strong><i>Jossa v Barclays Western Bank Ltd</i></strong><sup>47</sup> it was held that specific performance 
                      can be claimed as soon as the obligation to make performance is due and enforceable; it is not necessary that the debtor
                      should have fallen into <i>mora</i>. This tells us that specific perfomance is a right that vests on or accrues to a party
                      to a contract upon a valid conclusion of the contract. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Courts do not issue the order for specific performance willy nilly, there are ceratin guidelines that need to be followed. We will now proceed to discuss the scope for specific performance as well as discretion exercised by the courts when dealing with specific performance. It is also worth mention that before the court issues any order, there are certain requirements that must be met, similarly with the order for specific performance. These requirements will also be covered in this section. 
                    </p>

                        <sup>44</sup>This is a Latin term which connotes the principle that “contracts must be kept”. In its common sense, the principle refers private contracts, stressing that contained clauses are law between the parties and implies that nonfulfillment of respective obligations is a breach of the pact.

                      Scope for Specific Perfomance
                    </h4>

                    <p>
                      As alluded to above, every court order issued must be within certain parameters, according to Hutchison<sup>48</sup>  a claim for specific performance may take any one of (but is not limited to)  the following three forms:
                    </p>
                  
                    <ol type="a" class="text-left">
                      <li>A claim for the payment of a sum of money. </li>
                      <li>A claim for the performance of some positive act other that the payment of money. </li>
                      <li>A claim to enforce a negative obligation (that the other party should refrain from doing). </li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>
                      Starting with the first one, a claim for payment due under the contract is in reality a claim for specific performance, With regard to the enforcement of a negative contractual obligation, it takes the form of an interdict and it is most frequently encountered in cases involving the enforcement agreements on restraint of trade. With regard to the  the performance of a positive act, a simple example could  be the delivery of goods in a sale agreement.

                  Discretion of the Courts in Specific Performance
                  </h4>
                    <p>
                      Note that in Roman-Dutch law, the right to specific performance was almost absolute. Due to the influence of English law, however, our courts later came to accept that the remedy of specific performance is a discretionary one
                      which can be refused on the grounds of equity or public policy - see in this regard the case of<i> Heynes v Kingwilliamsontown Municipality</i><sup>49</sup> .
                      In practice, various guidelines were developed for the exercise of the court’s discretion, and over the years these guidelines have hardened to the point where they have almost attained the status of rules of law, effectively 
                      taking away the discretion of the court.   
                      A case illustrating this position is that of <strong><i>Schierhout v Minister of Justice</i></strong><sup>50</sup>.This gradual fettering of the court’s discretion attracted much criticism and was eventually rejected by the 
                      Appellate Division in the leading case of <strong><i>Benson v SA Mutual Life Assurance Society</i></strong><sup>51</sup>.In the <strong><i>Benson</i></strong> case, the court forcefully reasserted that, in principle, <i>“contracting 
                      parties have a right to specific performance, subject only to the court’s overriding discretion to refuse the order in appropriate cases...”</i>
                    </p>

                    <br>

                    <p>
                      In the local case of <strong><i> Nondlela Suzan Konyana v Ngwane Park Township (Pty) Limited <sup>52</sup></i></strong> ,  the most recent local judgment on this topic, Foxcroft JA, at paragraph [3] of his so far unreported judgment, stated that:
                    </p>

                    <div class="example z-depth-2 bg2 p-3 m-4">
                          <i>“Ms. Van der Walt referred us to the well-known decision in South Africa of<strong> Haynes v King Williamstown Municipality<sup>53</sup></strong>  She submitted, citing a passage from that 
                          judgment, that specific performance should not be granted in this matter, as it –“would operate unreasonably hardly on the defendant.” In the more recent 
                          decision of the same court in <strong>Benson v S.A Mutual Life Assurance Society<sup>54</sup></strong>  Hefer JA, in an “elucidation” of what De Villiers AJA had said in <strong>Haynes v King Williamstown Municipality</strong>,
                          said the following:
                          </i>
                          <i>“This does not mean that the discretion is in all respects completely unfettered.  It remains, after all, a judicial discretion and from its very nature arises the requirement that it is not to be exercised
                            capriciously, nor upon a wrong principle (Ex parte Neethling (supra at 335)).  It is aimed at preventing an injustice – for cases do arise where justice demands that a plaintiff be denied his right
                            to performance – and the basic principle thus is that the order which the Court makes should not produce an unjust result which will be the case, e.g.  if, in the particular circumstances, 
                            the order will operate unduly harshly on the defendant.” 
                          </i>
                        </div>

                        <p>
                          From the reading of this judgment it is clear that the Court will refuse to order specific performance where to do so would cause undue hardship to the defaulting or third parties. 
                          In this case, the respondent municipality had bound itself by contract to release 250 000 gallons of water per day to Haynes, but failed to honour this obligation during a period 
                          of severe and unprecedented drought. Haynes’ claim for specific performance was refused in the grounds that to have ordered it
                          <i>“would have very great hardship not 
                          only to the respondent but to the citizens of King Williamstown to whom the respondent owed a public duty to render an adequate supply of water”. 
                          </i>
                        </p>

                        <p>
                          All the above mentioned authorities were instrumental in the recent Supreme Court judgment of <strong><i>Tsabedze v University of Eswatini <sup>55</sup></i></strong> . Kerr<sup>56</sup> boldly asserts that there is no onus of proof

            </h4>
            <p>
              In order for a party to be sucessful in a claim for specific performance, two basic requirements as stated in <strong><i>Farmers’ Co-operative Society v Berry <sup>57</sup></i></strong>, must be met:
              </p>
                <ol type="a">
                  <li>That plaintiff must have performed or be ready to carry out his or her own obligations-that is, must tender performance in terms of the principle of reciprocity and</li>
                  <li>The defendant must be in a position to perform-that is, performance must be objectively and subjectively possible.</li> 
                </ol>
            <p>
                A third requirement to be added to the above which was not stated in the case is that the order for specific performance must not be against public policy. This additional requirement was introduced in <strong><i>Benson v SA Mutual Life Assurance Society <sup>58</sup></i></strong>where the court stated that <i>“the remedy of specific performance should always be granted or withheld in accordance with legal and public policy.”</i>

            <h1 class="text-center chapter-topic secondary-heading text-primary"><strong>Reciprocity Of Obligations </strong></h1>
          <p>
            In the leading case of <strong><i>BK Tooling (Edms) Bpk v Scope Precision Engineering (Edms) Bpk<sup>59</sup></i></strong> , the Appellate Division stated that reciprocal obligations are obligations that have been created in exchange of each other. A contract that contains reciprocal obligations is also called a reciprocal contract. The distinctive factor of a reciprocal contract, therefore, is that it is essentially aimed at accomplishing an exchange of obligations. Most contracts that create obligations for both parties will be regarded as reciprocal. 
            In the local case of <strong><i>G.S Franco Investments (Pty) Ltd v Carr Corp Investments (Pty) Ltd<sup>60</sup></i></strong>  Masuku J, referring to R.H. Christie’s analysis of the B.K. TOOLING case <i>(supra) per Jansen J.A.<sup>61</sup></i> , state the following : -
          </p>
          <div class="example z-depth-2 bg2 p-3 m-4">
          <p> 
            <i>
          "In B.K. Tooling (Edms) Bpk vs Scope Precision Engineering (Edms) Bptk 1979, S.A. 391 (A), the Appellate Division reviewed in some detail the history and scope of what have become known as the principle of reciprocity and the exceptio non adimpleti contractus. The principle of reciprocity recognises the fact that in many contracts the common intention of the parties, expressed or unexpressed, is that there should be an exchange of performances, and the exceptio gives effect to the recognition of this fact by serving as a defence for the defendant who is sued on the contract by a plaintiff who has not yet performed or tendered to perform. "
          </i>
          Similarly, Corbett J.  in <strong><i> Ese Financial Services (Pty) Ltd v Cramer <sup>62</sup></i></strong> stated that-
          </p>
          <p>
            <i>
          "In a bilateral contract, certain obligations may be reciprocal in the sense that the performance of one may be conditional upon the performance or tender of performance, of the other. The reciprocity may itself be bilateral in the sense that the performance, or tender of performance, of them represent concurrent conditions, that is, each is conditional upon the other. A ready example of this would be delivery of <strong>res vendita</strong> and payment of the purchase price under a cash sale...Alternatively, the reciprocity may be one-sided in the complete performance of his contractual obligation by the other party may be a condition precedent to die performance of his reciprocal obligation to other party. In other words the obligations, though inter¬dependent, fall to be performed consecutively. An example of this would be a <strong>locatio-conductio operis</strong> whereunder the <strong>conductor operis</strong> is normally obliged to carry out the work which he is engaged to do before the contract money can be claimed. In such a case, the obligation to pay the money is conditional on the pre-performance of the obligation to carry out the work, but, of course, the converse does not apply....
            </i>
          </p>
          <p>
            <i>
          Reciprocity of obligations does not depend, however, merely upon the time fixed for performance thereof. Thus, the mere fact that the contract specifies that the obligations are due to be performed on the same day does not lead to the inference that the parties intended them to be reciprocal.... For reciprocity to exist there must be such a relationship between the obligation by the one party and that due by the other party as to indicate that one was undertaken in exchange for the performance of the other and in cases where the obligations are not consecutive, vice versa.

          <p>
            According to Kerr, the term “incomplete performance” is used to refer to performance which, whether it is unfinished or defective, is not in all respects as required by the contract.  A defendant can rely on the <i>exceptio non adimpleti contractus <sup>63</sup></i> not only where the other party has failed to perform at all (<i>mora debitoris<sup>64</sup></i> ), but also in cases where the other party has failed to perform properly, or in full. The defective or incomplete performance need not be so serious as to justify cancellation of the contract; the innocent party is permitted to withhold his or her performance and raise the exception even where the defect or shortfall in the performance is relatively minor;
            provided that it is not so trivial as to fall within the principle of de <i>minimis lex non curat<sup>65</sup></i> .
          </p>
            <hr align="left" width="50%" color="black">

                <sup>63</sup>An exception or defense available in Roman law, that a person who is being sued for non-performance of contractual obligations can defend themselves by proving that the plaintiff did not perform their side of the bargain.
                <br>
                <sup>64</sup><i>Mora debitoris</i> is the culpable failure of a debtor in respect of a contract to make timeous performance of a positive obligation. There are five requirements for <i>mora debitoris</i>:
                <ol>
                  <li> 	Performance on the part of the debtor must be delayed.</li>
                  <li> 	Performance by the debtor must have been fixed for a particular time.</li>
                  <li> 	Despite failure to perform on the part of the debtor, there must still be a possibility of performance.</li>
                  <li> 	The delay must be the fault of the debtor.</li>
                  <li> 	The debtor must have not yet performed.</li>
                  </ol>

              The legal position concerning circumstances where <i>vis majorie</i> rather than the fault of either party was dealt with in LAW203.

            </h4>
            <p>
                It may happen that the party to whom performance is due (for example an owner for whom a house is being built) prevents 
                the other party from completing the performance (for example the owner refuses the building contractor access to the
                site after the house is half built). A case in point is that of <strong>Hitchins v Breslin</strong> 1939 TPD 677 at 682, also see 
                <i>Harrismith Building Society No.2 v Taylor</i> 1938 OPD 36 at 39. In such circumstances the party due to perform has
                an action on the contract for what he is due under the contract less any savings brought about by the fact that
                he has not performed fully (for examples less the cost of materials not supplied, see the case of BK Tooling).

            </h4>
              <p>
                If a party to a contract owing to his fault, no longer has it in his power to perform
                his obligation in full but is in a position to give incomplete performance, the other
                party is entitled to demand such performance and retains his ordinary remedies in regard 
                to that part of performance which he is denied, unless, as in the case of sale where risk 
                has passed and partial destruction is by <i>casus fortuitus<sup>66</sup></i> , the other party is relieved of liability.

            <ol type="a">
              <li>The general rule is that he may reject incomplete performance and claim proper performance. See the case of <strong><i>National Butchery Co v African Merchants Ltd<sup>68</sup></i></strong> , see also the case of <strong><i>Breslin v Hitchens<sup>69</sup></i></strong>.</li> 
              <li>He may claim performance and damages.</li>
              <li>He may accept the incomplete performance and claim damages in respect of the unfulfilled part of the obligation, see the case of <strong><i>Ariefdien v Soeker<sup>70</sup></i></strong> .</li>
              <li>He may claim cancellation and damages in the place of performance, see the case of <strong><i>SA Wood Turning Mills (Pty) Ltd v Price Brothers (Pty) Ltd<sup>71</sup></i></strong> . It must be remembered that cancellation can only be done if the breach of the contract is a major one. If the breach is minor, both parties remain bound by the contract. </li>

            Summary	This brings us to the end of a very interesting and important unit under the law of contract. 
            In this unit, we discussed the various types of performance and remedies available to same. We further 
            looked into a very fundamental and common remedy of specific performance and the requirements to be 
            fulfilled before a court of law can issue an order for specific performance. One critical aspect we 
            interrogated in this discussion is the fact that courts do not have absolute powers in granting the 
            relief of specific performance. In the next unit, we will discuss the various forms of terminating a contract. 
            Enjoy!
