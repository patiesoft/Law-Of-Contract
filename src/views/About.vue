        <p>
          As an adult learner your approach to learning will be different to that from your school days: 
          you will choose what you want to study, you will have professional and/or personal motivation
          for doing so and you will most likely be fitting your study activities around other professional 
          or domestic responsibilities.
        </p>
        <p>
          Essentially you will be taking control of your learning environment. As a consequence, you will
          need to consider performance issues related to time management, goal setting, stress management, 
          etc. Perhaps you will also need to reacquaint yourself in areas such as essay planning, coping with
          exams and using the web as a learning resource.
        </p>
        <p>
          Your most significant considerations will be time and space i.e. the time you dedicate to your 
          learning and the environment in which you engage in that learning.
        </p>
        <p>
          We recommend that you take time now—before starting your self-study—to familiarize yourself with these issues. 
          There are a number of excellent resources on the web. A few suggested links are:
