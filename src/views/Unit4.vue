        This Unit deals with the termination of contracts. There is a number of ways through which a contract may be terminated. 
        We must recall that once a party formally agrees to a contract, they become liable under law to fulfil their contractual
        obligations. Failure to perform the terms stated in the contract can result in a breach of contract law suit or other legal liabilities
      </p>
      <p class="text-left">
        However, there are some conditions under which a contract can be legally terminated before the contractual duties have been fulfilled. 
        This is known as “termination of contract” and may occur for many different reasons.
      </p>
      <p class="text-left">
        It is necessary at the foremost of our discussion to be able to distinguish between the termination of ‘an obligation’ under a contract 
        and the termination of ‘the contract’ as a whole. The understanding of this will assist you to appreciate the fact that a contract may be
        terminated when one party’s obligation to the contract is fulfilled, and also when the performance of the entire contact has been rendered.
        As AJ Kerr puts it73, “when all the obligations resting on both parties have been performed or otherwise cease to exist the whole contract 
        is at an end, it terminates, it ceases to exist, and it passes into history”.

    <h1 class="text-center chapter-topic  secondary-heading text-primary"><strong>Termination Of Contractual Obligation</strong></h1>

    <h4  class="text-left chapter-topic secondary-heading text-primary"><strong>Introduction</strong></h4>
    <p>
      A contract is terminated after being performed. Performance means the party must perform its own obligations
      as envisaged by the contract. Such performance should be made by the party upon whom the obligation is imposed and 
      that performance must be rendered to the person recognised by the law as being competent to receive the performance:
      See Hanornag SA (Pty) Ltd v Otto 1940 CPD 437.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before termination is said to have occurred in a contract, first and foremost the court must establish the parties’ 
      intention, taking into account the surrounding circumstances and everything which gives due to that mutual intention. 
      What the court does there is to find what the parties would have wished to have their minds been directed, whether the
      performance of that contract was to be specific and equivalent. This basic rule goes back to Roman law and simple stated:
      the nature of performance which discharges and obligation is that which is due under the contract.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the case of Bold v Cooper and Another 1949(1) SA 1195 (W) at 1200 Muray J said:
    </p>
    <div>
      <p>
        “The mere delivery of cheque, in a cash transaction, is in disputably not payment of cash-it is only when the cheque is paid 
        that the purchaser has complied with his obligation to pay cash and only then does dominium [of a movable thing sold] pass.”
      </p>
    </div>
    <p>
      From the foregoing example it is demonstrated that the obligation of the contracting parties is subject to the nature of the 
      performance which then discharges the obligations due under the contract. It is only when in the example of Cooper, that when 
      the cheque was paid the obligation was complied with and therefore one could have said the contract could then be terminated 
      after such performance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Secondly, should there be no clause as to the parties’ mutual intention the presumption that the performance was to be specific, 
      though this presumption is rebuttable in law. Thirdly, the court will in case of doubt be more likely to be in favour of equivalent 
      performance. If the manner of the act to be performed is immaterial or where performance, informa specific performance through no fault
      of the promissor: See the case of Peters Hammon vs Koksrud
    </p>
    <p>
      Fourthly, the act of performance tendered where such is permissible must in the just instance be an equivalent to that mentioned in the contract or be of such a nature that it can make no material difference to the promise. What we must note finally when dealing with the termination of a contract and the considerations thereto, the court`s paramount obligation is to do justice between man and man. In doing this, 
            the court is guided by the terms and circumstances in the contract under consideration.

<!-- When Is Termination Of Contracts Lawful -->
  <div class="Chapter">
      <h1 class="text-center chapter-topic secondary-heading text-primary"><strong>When Is Termination Of Contracts Lawful</strong></h1>
      <p>There are ten ways in which a contract may be terminated:</p>
      <ol id="contentlist" style="list-style-type:decimal">
        <li>Performance or payment</li>
        <li>Release</li>
        <li>Novation</li>
        <li>Merger</li>
        <li>Impossibility of performance</li>
        <li>Set-off</li>
        <li>Prescription</li>
        <li>nsolvency and rehabilitation</li>
        <li>Death</li>
        <li>Breach</li>
      </ol>

  <ol sytle="a">
        <h5 class="h5">
          <li>Performance or payment</li>
        </h5>
          
        <p>
          Thi4 is the most common way of ending contracts: each party 
          simply does what he or she was meant to do. If the debt is a money debt, the creditor is entitled 
          to payment in legal tender, that is, bank notes and coins. Bank notes must be accepted for any amount; 
          silver coins up to R4,00; and bronze or copper coins up to 10cents. Payment by cheque (other than post-dated cheques) 
          is equivalent to payment by cash, subject to the condition that the cheque will be met<sup>76</sup>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Where several debts are owed to the creditor, the creditor may inform the debtor that he or she will appropriate a payment 
          in respect of a certain debt, generally one that bears interest or the oldest debt. Interest will normally be paid before capital. 
          Where money is paid to a creditor in the mistaken belief that the debtor is indebted to the creditor, there is no contract to sue upon. 
          Instead, the debtor may rely on the doctrine of justified enrichment and recover his or her money by using the <i>condition debiti</i> 
          (a form of enrichment action founded in Roman law).
        </p>

        <h5 class="h5">
          <li>Release </li>
        </h5> 
        <p>
          This 4s known as waiver, or discharge by agreement. The parties may waive their rights and release each other from their respective 
          rights and obligations. In effect, this means that one or both parties abandon rights to the contract<sup>77</sup>.
        </p>

        <h5 class="h5">
          <li>Novation</li>
        </h5> 
        <p>
          It 4s possible to substitute a new contract for the original one (novation). The settlement of a dispute, or an agreement to compromise, 
          both discharge the original obligation, and a new one may be substituted in its place<sup>78</sup>.
        </p>
        <p>
          According to Kopel<sup>79</sup> , common forms of novation include:
          <ul>
            <li> <strong>Compromise (transaction):</strong> the parties by agreement, may settle an obligation for example the debtor tenders to the creditor a lesser
              amount than that which he or she owes, in full and final settlement.
            </li>
            <li> 
                  <strong>Cession (new creditor):</strong> previously discussed.        
            </li>
            <li><strong>Delegation (new debtor):</strong> previously discussed.</li>
          </ul>
        </p>

        <h5 class="h5">
          <li>Merger<i>(confusio)</i>  </li>
        </h5>

        <p>
          Mer4er occurs when the qualities of debtor and creditor coincide in the same person in respect of the same obligation, for example when a tenant 
          purchase the same property that he or she has been renting<sup>80</sup>.
        </p>

        <!-- Case law -->
        <div>
        <h4 class="h4"> <i class="fas fa-gavel"> Case Law</i></h4>
          <p>
            In Grootchwaing Salt works Ltd v Van Tonder81, a tenant hired land with a salt pan. The lease gave the tenant rights to some of the adjoining ground, which was not let. The tenant later bought the ground over which the lease has existed. The court held that the rights over the adjoining ground had come to an end.

         <br>
       <h5 class="h5">
         <li>Impossibility of Performance</li>
         </h5>
        <p>
          A contract that is initially impossible to perform is void. Supervening impossibility of performance is voidable. The contract is discharged as  
          though it had been impossible from the very beginning<sup>82</sup>. All rights and duties between the parties fall away, and there is no breach or liability
          for damages. What has already been performed is usually recoverable on the basis of unjustified enrichment. Supervening impossibility may arise through an 
          act of God, where the law is changed to make performance dies or becomes incapacitated<sup>83</sup>.
        </p>
     
     <br>
        <!-- Case Law -->
        <div>
          <h4 class="h4"> <i class="fas fa-gavel"> Case Law</i></h4>
          <p>
            In <i>Peters Flamman and Company v Kokstad Municipality<sup>84</sup> </i>, a contract had been entered into a few years before the First World War to provide 
            lighting services for a period of twenty years. The partners of the suppliers were found to be enemy aliens, and interned. The business was
            wound up in terms of legislation that prohibited trading with enemies of the country. The court held that it had become impossible for the
            partners to render the performance required in terms of the contract.
          </p>
        </div>
        <!-- /Case Law -->
        <br>

        <p>
          Kopel<sup>85</sup> argues that supervening impossibility will not discharge a contract in any of the following cases:
          <ul>
            <li>The parties expressly or impliedly agreed that it should not <sup>86</sup></li>
            <li>The impossibility is relative or subjectively absolute.</li>
            <li>The impossibility is due to the fault of the person relying on it <sup>87</sup>.</li>
            <li>
              The debtor is in <i>mora</i> (has failed to perform on time); unless he or she can show that the event would have occurred in any case. For example, 
              if a building being sold is destroyed by an earthquake, the debtor will be able to claim supervening impossibility because the earthquake 
              would still have destroyed the building even if the debtor had performed on time.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </p>
   
   <br>
        <!-- Case Law -->
        <div>
          <h4 class="h4"> <i class="fas fa-gavel"> Case Law</i></h4>
          <p>
            In <strong><i>Hersman v Shapiro & Company<sup>88</sup></i></strong>, a dealer in corn sold a consignment in advance. He argued that because of a crop failure it was impossible to 
            deliver the goods. The court held that there had been no evidence that the right quality and quantity of corn was absolutely unobtainable in all 
            growing areas. The nature of speculative contract meant that it would have been contemplated by the seller that he might have to pay more than the 
            resale price if there was a scarcity of corn available. In <strong><i>Benjamin v Myers</i></strong> <sup>89</sup>, the tenant of a garage broke the law relating to the supply of petrol. 
            In terms of his lease, he had undertaken to provide petrol for sale at the garage. The court held that the tenant could not defend the action of landlord 
            in evicting him, as this was due to his wrongful conduct.
          </p>
        </div>
        <!-- /Case Law -->

        <h5 class="h5">
          <li> Set-off (Compensation)</li> 
        </h5>
        <p>
          If each party to a contract is indebted to the other party, the debts are balanced against each other. The lesser debt is discharged or both debts are discharged if they are equal90.
          In the case of <strong><i>Altech Data (Pty) Ltd v MB Technologies (Pty) Ltd)</i></strong><sup>91</sup>, for set off to operate, four (4) requirements must be met:
          <ul>
            <li>
              The debts must be due between the same parties in the same capacities.
            </li>
            <li>
              Both debts must be of money or movable property of the same kind.
            </li>
            <li>
              The debts must be liquid, that is, fixed or in amounts that are easy to determine. If a debt is liquid, this means that its exact amount is known and no evidence 
              is required to establish the amount owed.
            </li>
            <li>Both debts must unconditional, due, and payable.</li>
          </ul>
          The parties may agree to exclude any set-off operating<sup>92</sup>.
        </p>

        <h5 class="h5">
          <li>Prescription (Position in South Africa)</li>
        </h5 >
        <p>
          In terms of the South African Prescription Act <sup>93</sup>, it is possible to acquire rights, or be released from obligations, simply by the passing of time. In this way, prescription
          provides legal certainty<sup>94</sup>. The Institution of Legal Proceedings against certain Organs of State Act <sup>95</sup> relates to any cause of action where the state is liable for payment
          of damages. The Act applies t claims due before 28 November 2002 but not yet prescribed, and to claims due after 28 November 2002 <sub>96</sub> .
        </p>
        <p>
          An action against the state will include any action against any organ of state, including:
          <ul>
            <li>Any national government department</li>
            <li>Any provincial administration and department</li>
            <li>Any municipality at the local sphere of Government established under section 151 of the Constitution <sup>97</sup> </li>
            <li>Any functionary or institution exercising powers or performing functions under the Constitution98 or provincial constitution.</li>
            <li>The South African Marine Safety Authority.</li>
            <li>The South African National Roads Agency Limited.</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
          Where the state is the debtor, notice must be given to the state within six months from the date on which the claim became due. Notice must be in writing, briefly setting out
          the facts giving rise to the claim, giving particulars that are within the knowledge of the claimant (including the known or estimated damages), and giving notice of intention 
          to institute the legal proceedings in question<sup>99</sup>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Where the state relies on the failure to give the proper notice in time, a claimant may apply to court for permission to provide the notice late. This is called condonation.
          Leave to institute legal proceedings may be granted if good cause exists for the failure to give proper notice, and the state is not unreasonably prejudiced by that failure. 
          Condonation cannot be granted after the debt has prescribed. Court process may not be served until 30 ordinary days have expired after the written notice was served on the State. 
          If court process is served permanently, it will not be invalid but will be regarding as having been served on the first day after expiry of the thirty-day period.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are two types of prescription: extinctive prescription and acquisitive prescription.
          <ul>
            <li>
            <strong> Extinctive prescription:</strong> this refers to the lapsing of the claim by the passing of time. In this way the law provides that creditors only should have a certain amount of time 
              in the time in which to claim debts owed to them, or they lose their rights. Extinctive prescription will intervene over different time periods in respect of different rights:
              <ul>
                <li>
                <strong>Thirty years:</strong> Debt secured by a mortgage bond judgement debt, or taxes, mineral royalties, or profits payable to the State.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Fifteen years:</strong> Debt owed to the state as result of loan, or sale or lease of land to the debtor by the State.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Six years:</strong> Debt arising from a bill of exchange, negotiable instrument or notarial contract.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Three year:</strong> any other debt or claim.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </p>

        <p>
          Controversial cases involving prescription deal with situations where legal action is commenced a 
          long time after original events started. Courts are sometimes faced with difficult decisions as to when the cause of 
          action arose- if a plaintiff delays starting legal proceedings for too long, the defendant may argue successfully 
          that the claim has prescribed.

              In  <strong><i>Van Zijl v Hoogenhout</i></strong>  <sup>100</sup>, a woman claimed she had been sexually abused by her uncle from when she was six until 
              she reached fifteen years of age. This lasted from 1958 to 1967. The abused caused long-term physical, psychological 
              and emotional damage. Although she reached majority in 1973, she instituted the action against the alleged abuser only
              in 1999. When she sued in 1999, the respondent alleged that the claim had prescribed in 1976, three years after she had 
              turned 21. The court held that prescription penalized unreasonable inaction, not inability to act. The evidence showed 
              that she had been aware until 1997, when she watched a television Programme dealing with child sexual abuse and later 
              talked to a friend who studies psychology, that it was not she, but her abuser, who was responsible for the assaults.
              It was only then that she acquired a rational appreciation that he was to blame and thus a meaningful knowledge of 
              the wrong that set prescription in motion.

        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Interruption:</strong>  on the occurrence of certain events, the time period for the prescription of rights may be extended for a 
            period of time: if the debtor expressly or tacitly acknowledges liability for the debt; in which case prescription starts 
            to run afresh from the date of that acknowledgement. A Debtor may acknowledge the debt, or debt or admit liability for it, 
            for example by making part payments. If the parties extend the due date for payment of the debt, for example a contractual 
            debt, in which case prescription starts to run from the new date. If the debt is claimed by serving court process on the debtor, 
            in which case a new period of thirty years starts to run from the date of final judgement. For example, the service of a summons 
            on the last day within the period for which extinctive prescription would normally apply has the effect of interrupting prescription 
            for a period of one year.
          </li>

              In Nedcor Bank Ltd v Rundle101, the court was asked to decide when prescription recommences after interruption caused by the filing
              of claim against a company in liquidation. The court held that the running of prescription of a money debt, interrupted by the filing 
              of a claim against a company in liquidation, recommences on confirmation by the Master of the final liquidation and distribution account.

          The relevant rules of our courts provide that once a summons is served, the plaintiff has twelve months to take further steps, after which the 
          summons will lapse. On the occurrence of the specified event, prescription must commence de novo, that is, it must start all over again. For example, 
          a creditor will normally have three years from the date that credit instalment sale agreement was entered into or the date of the most recent payment 
          (whichever is the later) to issue a summons to launch court action against a customer for payment, failing which the debt will prescribe. If the debtor 
          makes a single payment during this time or signs an acknowledgement debt, the three-year period will begin to run again from the new date.

            <li>
              <strong>Suspension:</strong> certain impediments suspend the running of prescription until a period of one year has passed from the date when the date 
              when impediment ceased to exist. The following are examples of impediments that will serve to suspend prescription from running:
            </li>
            <ul>
              <li>The creditor is a minor</li>
              <li>The creditor is an insane person or a person under curatorship</li>
              <li>The creditor is prevented from interrupting prescription by vis major</li>
              <li>The debtor is outside the boarders of South Africa</li>
              <li>The debtor and creditor are married to each other</li>
              <li>The creditor and the debtor are partners and the debt is one arising from the partnership</li>
              <li>The creditor is a juristic person and the debtor is a member of the governing board of that juristic person</li>
              <li>The debt is the subject of dispute submitted for arbitration</li>
              <li>The debt is the subject of a claim filed against the estate of a deceased debtor or the insolvent estate of a debtor.</li>

            Unlike in the Republic of South Africa where there is law regulating prescription, we do not have such a statute in Eswatini. This submission was clearly unpacked 
            in the local case of Shell South African Energy (Pty) Ltd v Fannie Constantine Mthethwa <sup>102</sup> The plea of prescription raised by the Plaintiff is based upon 
            the cause of action raised by the Defendant in his counterclaim, being the breach of the alleged contract of employment on 11 June 2008. The Plaintiff pleads that on 
            the Defendant’s case the Defendant’s cause of action arose on the date of the alleged breach (the termination of the alleged contract of employment) which was 11 June 
            2008. It is pleaded that the Defendant served and filed his counterclaim on 22 August 2011, which is more than three years after the debt and cause of action upon which 
            the Plaintiff relies arose. On this basis the Plaintiff avers that the counterclaim has been extinguished by prescription.
          </p>

            It was held that that prescription in Roman Dutch Law has its source in the Roman Law. In South Africa the first statutory regulation was in the Cape where the Prescription
            Act of 1861 was passed. In the Transvaal, the Prescription Act 26 of 1904 was passed. This provided for a period of prescription in respect of proceedings at common law known 
            as actio redhibitoria or the actio quanti minoris of one year. It also provided for various prescriptive periods for other causes of action listed in sections 4 and 5 thereon. 
            In respect of matters for which a period was not fixed, the period was thirty years. (See South African Law Reform Commission discussion paper 12, July 2011).
          </p>
          <p>
            It was further stated in this case that in Swaziland the Roman Dutch Law and laws in force in the Transvaal as at 15th October, 1904 were received in terms of the reception statute 
            in 1907 In terms of the General Law and Administration No. 4 of 1907 section 3 – “the roman Dutch common law … shall be the law in Swaziland … the statutes in force in force in the 
            Transvaal on the 15th October, 1904, and the statutory regulations there under shall mutatis mutandis and as far as they may be applicable be in force in Swaziland”.
          </p>

          <p>
            The application of prescription was also tested in the local case of FirstRand Bank Limited v Nedbank Eswatini Limited <strong>103</strong>.

        <p>
          A person whose liabilities exceed his or her assets may be declared by the High Court to be insolvent. Certain contracts entered into by the
          insolvent prior to sequestration may be set aside by the court. The rehabilitation of the insolvent discharges all debts incurred prior to sequestration.
          In Eswatini, insolvency is regulated by the Insolvency Act, 1955.

          As a general rule, the executor of the estate of a deceased person is liable in his or her representative capacity for all contracts for which the deceased 
          would have been liable in his or her lifetime, to the extent of the assets in the deceased estate. Similarly, the executor may claim from others the fulfilment 
          of contracts for the benefit of the estate.
        </p>
        <p>
          Contractual rights and duties of the deceased will not pass to the executor if these rights are personal, for example:
          <ul>
            <li>Contracts of service</li>
            <li>ontracts dependent on the skill or scientific knowledge of the deceased</li>
            <li>Contracts which the parties intended to be performed personally by the deceased</li>
            <li>
              In the absence of express provisions to the contrary, contracts of agency terminate on the death of the principal or agent. The same applies to contracts of partnership.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
          It is worth mention that Section 32 of Act 24 of 1913 (South Africa) is similar to section 22 of the Swaziland Administration of Estates Act No. 28 of 1902 (the Act) provides 
          that:“ The estates of all persons dying either testate or intestate shall be administered and distributed according to law under letters of administration to be granted in the 
          form contained in Schedule “B”, by the Master to the testamentary executors duly appointed by such deceased persons, or to such persons who are in default of testamentary executors 
          appointed executors dative in terms of this Act.

        <p>
          When the party refuses or fails to perform as he or she agreed to, the contract has been breached104. We refer to the person who is owed performance as the creditor, and the 
          person who must perform as the debtor. Normally a creditor will be the party suing the debtor for performance. Sometimes, however, the debtor might then respond by alleging 
          that the creditor in fact failed to perform as required and is therefore the one who breached the contract. The facts of each case will have bearing on which party caused the breach.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are generally five ways in which a contract may be breached;
          <ul>
            <li>Repudiation.</li>
            <li>Mora debitoris.</li>
            <li>Mora creditoris.</li>

      From the above discussion, it is clear that termination of a contract occurs in various forms. The determination factor in all the various forms is that no rights and obligations ensue from the parties upon the termination of the contract. 
      This is further evident in that once there is termination, neither of the parties is bound to the other and none of them can have a claim against the other once termination is established. Of further critical importance which the court 
      establishes in as far as termination is concerned is factoring on the intention of the parties taking into account the surrounding circumstances and everything which gives right or due to the intention to terminate a contract. We will now 
      proceed to discuss breach of contract in the next unit. Enjoy!
